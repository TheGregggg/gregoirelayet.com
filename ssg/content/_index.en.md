Passionate about computers and electronics, I like to programme software and tinker hardware. I am really interested in system and low level programming. 

I am proficient in web programming using Python, Django/FastAPI/Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Caddy.
I am now interested in learning in depth low level programming with C, Rust and Zig.

I'm trying to convince my family and friends to switch to open source and privacy respecting technologies.
So I try myself to have a mind full usage of the internet, my data and my screens times sucked by all these social networks.
For me, it's really important to be the owner of our data,  both personal data and the media we consume. So I'm trying to own (without DRM) the movies, series, music, and games that are important to me, to be truly independent of any third-party services.
